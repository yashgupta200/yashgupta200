Basic_calculator
he code is a simple calculator program written in C that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. Below is a detailed analysis of the code structure, including the purpose and functionality of each part. Functionality Overview Header Files:

#include <stdio.h>: Includes the standard input/output library for functions like printf and scanf. #include <stdlib.h>: Includes the standard library for general utilities, though it's not used in this particular code. main Function:

The main function is the entry point of the program. Variable Declarations:

int menu: Holds the user's choice of arithmetic operation. float num1, num2, result: Used to store the numbers entered by the user and the result of the arithmetic operation. Displaying the Menu:

printf statements display the list of arithmetic operations available. Reading User Input:

scanf("%d", &menu): Reads the user's choice for the arithmetic operation. scanf("%f", &num1) and scanf("%f", &num2): Read the two floating-point numbers for the calculation. Switch Statement:

Directs the flow of the program based on the user's menu choice. Each case corresponds to a specific arithmetic operation: Case 1: Performs addition (result = num1 + num2). Case 2: Performs subtraction (result = num1 - num2). Case 3: Performs multiplication (result = num1 * num2). Case 4: Performs division, with an additional check for division by zero (result = num1 / num2). Default Case: Handles invalid menu choices by prompting the user to enter a correct number. Error Handling:

For division, it checks if num2 is zero to avoid division by zero errors. Program Termination:

return 0; signifies the successful termination of the program. This code covers basic calculator functionality and handles basic input validation for division by zero. Further improvements could include more robust error handling, such as validating non-numeric input and handling invalid floating-point entries.
